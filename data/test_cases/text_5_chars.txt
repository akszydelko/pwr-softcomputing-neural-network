The Grapes of Wrath

It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men. It is the monster. Men made it, but they can not control it.

The laboring people hated Okies because a hungry man must work, and if he must work, if he has to work, the wage payer automatically gives him less for his work, and then no one can get more.

The owners hated them because the owners knew they were soft and the Okies strong, that they were fed and the Okies hungry, and perhaps the owners had heard from their grandfathers how easy it is to steal land from a soft man if you are fierce and hungry and armed.

The great owners ignored the three cries of history. When property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. When a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need. Repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed.

Wages went down and prices stayed up. And pretty soon now we will have serfs again. The companies invented a new method. A great owner bought a cannery. And when the peaches and the pears ripe he cut the price of fruit below the cost of raising it. And as cannery owner he paid himself a low price for the fruit and kept the price of canned goods up and took his profit. And the little farmers who owned no canneries lost their farms.

The land fell into fewer hands, the number of dispossessed increased, and every effort of the great owners was directed at repression. The changing economy was ignored, plans for change ignored, and only means to destroy the revolt were considered, while the causes of revolt went on.

The great companies did not know that the line between hunger and anger is a thin line. And money that might have gone to wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling. And the anger began to ferment.
