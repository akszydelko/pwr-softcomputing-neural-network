The meaning of life

Why are we here. What is life all about.
Is God really real, or is there some doubt.

Well, tonight, we are going to sort it all out, 
For, tonight, it is The Meaning of Life. 

What is the point of all this hoax. 
Is it the chicken and the egg time. Are we just yolks.

Or, perhaps, we are just one of Gods little jokes. 
Well, ce est le Meaning of Life. 

Is life just a game where we make up the rules 
While we are searching for something to say, 

Or are we just simply spiralling coils 
Of self replicating DNA. Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay. 
In this life, what is our fate. 
Is there Heaven and Hell. Do we reincarnate. 

Is mankind evolving, or is it too late. 
Well, tonight, here is The Meaning of Life. 
For millions, this life is a sad vale of tears, 

Sitting around with rien nothing to say 

While the scientists say we are just simply spiralling coils 
Of self replicating DNA. Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay. 
So, just why why are we here, 

And just what what what what do we fear. 
Well, ce soir, for a change, it will all be made clear, 
For this is The Meaning of Life. Ce est le sens de la vie. 
This is The Meaning of Life.
